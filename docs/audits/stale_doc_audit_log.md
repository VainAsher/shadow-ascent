# Shadow Ascent — Stale Doc Audit Log

## Audit 2026-07-16

### Verdict
PARTIAL

### Key Findings

1. **CLAUDE.md (canonical context)** — **STALE (35th consecutive cycle)**: M3 still reads `Active — V3 save envelope + checksum guard done; full exit criteria TBD`; M4 still reads `Queued`. Both confirmed wrong: `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/M3_RELEASE_GATE.md`, and `docs/MILESTONE_GATE_M4_FULL.md` all confirm M3 closed 2026-05-08 and M4 completed 2026-05-15. `git diff --stat HEAD~5 HEAD` shows only `docs/audits/` changes in the last 5 commits — no new code-introduced staleness since the 2026-07-14 audit. CLAUDE.md is loaded on every session start; both stale entries corrupt every planning decision made from it.

2. **docs/CURRENT_STATE.md** — **STALE (1 item, persistent)**: `last_updated: 2026-05-15` frontmatter does not reflect four 2026-06-09 code commits (`d004f19 feat(data): add M4 campaign catalogs and room specs`, `a94c096 feat(core): extend mission story and regression runtime`, `dea2d41 feat(client): wire authored world routing and interactions`, `17da791 test(runtime): add Act I route campaign and world coverage`). New test classes and `data/room_specs/*.json` vertical slice files confirmed present but undocumented in "What Is Implemented". Verification evidence still dated 2026-05-14; no gate run recorded against the June code changes. "Next Actions" item 2 (M4 campaign content) is not struck through, contradicting the "Open Issues" section where M4 is marked resolved and the Product State table which marks M4 complete.

3. **docs/ROADMAP.md** — **STALE (2 items, persistent)**:
   - M4 section header tag: `` `active` `` — `CURRENT_STATE.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG.md` section 0 confirm M4 complete (2026-05-15); gate evidence at `docs/MILESTONE_GATE_M4_FULL.md`. Should be `` `completed` ``.
   - M6 "Delivered in this lane" section records "Regression harness: 49/49 PASS"; `CURRENT_STATE.md` P2 gate evidence confirms 54/54 sections.

4. **docs/MIGRATION_MAP.md** — **STALE (2 items, persistent)**:
   - Wave 4 table row (line 81): `SimPlayer.java` status `queued` targeting `core/.../sim/SimPlayer.java` — orphan row never removed; correct `done` row at line 91 targets `core/.../simulation/SimPlayer.java` (confirmed present).
   - Wave 5 table missing entries for `InputHandler.java`, `RoomGeometry.java`, `SaveLoad.java` — all three confirmed present at `java/client/src/main/java/com/shadowascent/client/`.

5. **docs/IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG.md** — **STALE (1 item, persistent)**: Section 7 header reads "M5 Systemic World Simulation Foundation (active)" — M5 has been complete since 2026-05-07 and all tasks are marked `[x]`. Should read "(completed)".

6. **docs/guides/DEVELOPER_WORKFLOW.md** — **STALE (3 items, persistent)**:
   - Line ~215: `` `RegressionTest.java (~100KB, 49 tests)` `` — `CURRENT_STATE.md` P2 gate evidence confirms 54/54 sections; actual test section count exceeds 49.
   - Wave 4/5 extraction list `(CombatSubsystem, TraversalSubsystem, UISubsystem, MinimapRenderer)` omits three Wave 5 phase-2 extractions completed 2026-05-09: `HudRenderer`, `StoryManager`, `MissionUiCoordinator`.
   - CI section claims `runWorldSimulationDiagnostics` runs only "on merge"; all gate tasks run on every `push` and `pull_request` trigger — not split by merge.

7. **Missing references** — None: all Gradle tasks (`runRegressionTests`, `runDataContractDiagnostics`, `runWorldgenDiagnostics`, `runWorldSimulationDiagnostics`, `runRegionalStreamingDiagnostics`, `runPlayableClient`, `runGame`, `packSprites`) confirmed present in `build.gradle.kts`. All referenced class names (`EchoPuzzleSolution`, `EchoPuzzleEvaluator`, `RegionManifest`, `RegionLoader`, `MutationOverlay`, `WorldSimulationTick`, `QuestEcologyEngine`, `CollisionWorld`, `SaveMigrationMatrix`, `DesktopLauncher`, `ShadowAscentGame`, `HubScreen`, `HudRenderer`, `StoryManager`, `MissionUiCoordinator`, `InputHandler`, `RoomGeometry`, `SaveLoad`, `GameInputProcessor`, `SpriteWorldRenderer`, `HudOverlayRenderer`, `HudOverlayState`, `MinimapOverlayRenderer`, `ModalOverlayManager`, `AudioManager`, `TitleScreen`, `AuthoringWorldBootstrap`, `ContractMissionTemplateCatalog`, `BossPatternLibrary`, `PlayerInputController`, `PlayableControllerModel`) confirmed under `java/`. All data files (`elastic_chunk_templates.json`, `adaptation_rules.json`, `schemas/narrative_data_schema.json`, `world_state.json`, `faction_state.json`, `settlement_state.json`, all worldgen regions/sections) exist under `data/`. All referenced docs (`M3_RELEASE_GATE.md`, `MILESTONE_GATE_M4_FULL.md`, `MILESTONE_A_GATE.md`, `ACT_I_QA_ROUTE.md`, `NORTH_STAR_EXECUTION_MATRIX.md`, `DOC_MAINTENANCE_PLAN.md`, `planning/PRODUCTION_STACK_AND_LONG_TERM_PLAN.md`, `guides/CODEX_CLI_SETUP.md`) confirmed present.

### Recommended Next Step
Fix `CLAUDE.md` milestone table immediately — M3 staleness has reached its **35th consecutive audit cycle** with zero fixes applied. In a single targeted edit: change M3 from `Active — V3 save envelope + checksum guard done; full exit criteria TBD` to `Complete (2026-05-08)`, change M4 from `Queued` to `Complete (2026-05-15)`, and update the `as of` date to 2026-07-16. These two lines are the highest-impact staleness fix in the project and require under five minutes to apply.

### Key Findings

1. **CLAUDE.md (canonical context)** — **STALE (36th consecutive cycle)**: M3 still reads `Active — V3 save envelope + checksum guard done; full exit criteria TBD`; M4 still reads `Queued`.

CLAUDE.md is loaded on every session start; both stale entries corrupt every planning decision made from it.

2. **docs/CURRENT_STATE.md** — **STALE (1 item, persistent)**: `last_updated: 2026-05-15` frontmatter does not reflect four 2026-06-09 code commits (`d004f19 feat(data): add M4 campaign catalogs and room specs`, `a94c096 feat(core): extend mission story and regression runtime`, `dea2d41 feat(client): wire authored world routing and interactions`, `17da791 test(runtime): add Act I route campaign and world coverage`). New test classes and `data/room_specs/*.json` vertical slice files confirmed present but undocumented in "What Is Implemented". Verification evidence still dated 2026-05-14; no gate run recorded against the June code changes. "Next Actions" item 2 (M4 campaign content) is not struck through, contradicting the "Open Issues" section where M4 is marked resolved and the Product State table which marks M4 complete.

3. **docs/ROADMAP.md** — **STALE (2 items, persistent)**:
   - M4 section header tag: `` `active` `` — `CURRENT_STATE.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG.md` section 0 confirm M4 complete (2026-05-15); gate evidence at `docs/MILESTONE_GATE_M4_FULL.md`. Should be `` `completed` ``.
   - M6 "Delivered in this lane" section records "Regression harness: 49/49 PASS"; `CURRENT_STATE.md` P2 gate evidence confirms 54/54 sections.

4. **docs/MIGRATION_MAP.md** — **STALE (2 items, persistent)**:
   - Wave 4 table row (line 81): `SimPlayer.java` status `queued` targeting `core/.../sim/SimPlayer.java` — orphan row never removed; correct `done` row at line 91 targets `core/.../simulation/SimPlayer.java` (confirmed present at `java/core/.../simulation/SimPlayer.java`).
   - Wave 5 table missing entries for `InputHandler.java`, `RoomGeometry.java`, `SaveLoad.java` — all three confirmed present at `java/client/src/main/java/com/shadowascent/client/`.

5. **docs/IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG.md** — **STALE (1 item, persistent)**: Section 7 header reads "M5 Systemic World Simulation Foundation (active)" — M5 has been complete since 2026-05-07 and all tasks are marked `[x]`. Should read "(completed)".

6. **docs/guides/DEVELOPER_WORKFLOW.md** — **STALE (3 items, persistent)**:
   - Line ~215: `` `RegressionTest.java (~100KB, 49 tests)` `` — `CURRENT_STATE.md` P2 gate evidence confirms 54/54 sections; actual test section count exceeds 49.
   - Wave 4/5 extraction list `(CombatSubsystem, TraversalSubsystem, UISubsystem, MinimapRenderer)` omits three Wave 5 phase-2 extractions completed 2026-05-09: `HudRenderer`, `StoryManager`, `MissionUiCoordinator`.
   - CI section claims `runWorldSimulationDiagnostics` runs only "on merge"; all gate tasks run on every `push` and `pull_request` trigger — not split by merge.

7. **Missing references** — None: all Gradle tasks (`runRegressionTests`, `runDataContractDiagnostics`, `runWorldgenDiagnostics`, `runWorldSimulationDiagnostics`, `runRegionalStreamingDiagnostics`, `runPlayableClient`, `runGame`, `packSprites`) confirmed present in `build.gradle.kts`. All referenced class names (`EchoPuzzleSolution`, `EchoPuzzleEvaluator`, `RegionManifest`, `RegionLoader`, `MutationOverlay`, `WorldSimulationTick`, `QuestEcologyEngine`, `CollisionWorld`, `SaveMigrationMatrix`, `DesktopLauncher`, `ShadowAscentGame`, `HubScreen`, `HudRenderer`, `StoryManager`, `MissionUiCoordinator`, `InputHandler`, `RoomGeometry`, `SaveLoad`, `GameInputProcessor`, `SpriteWorldRenderer`, `HudOverlayRenderer`, `HudOverlayState`, `MinimapOverlayRenderer`, `ModalOverlayManager`, `AudioManager`, `TitleScreen`, `AuthoringWorldBootstrap`, `ContractMissionTemplateCatalog`, `BossPatternLibrary`, `PlayerInputController`) confirmed under `java/`. All data files (`elastic_chunk_templates.json`, `adaptation_rules.json`, `schemas/narrative_data_schema.json`, `world_state.json`, `faction_state.json`, `settlement_state.json`, all worldgen regions/sections) exist under `data/`.

### Recommended Next Step
Fix `CLAUDE.md` milestone table immediately — M3 staleness has reached its **36th consecutive audit cycle** with zero fixes applied. In a single targeted edit: change M3 from `Active — V3 save envelope + checksum guard done; full exit criteria TBD` to `Complete (2026-05-08)`, change M4 from `Queued` to `Complete (2026-05-15)`, and update the `as of` date to 2026-07-16. This 2-line change eliminates the highest-impact planning-context corruption in the project and takes under five minutes to apply.

### Key Findings

1. **CLAUDE.md (canonical context)** — **STALE (37th consecutive cycle)**: M3 still reads `Active — V3 save envelope + checksum guard done; full exit criteria TBD`; M4 still reads `Queued`. Both confirmed wrong: `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/M3_RELEASE_GATE.md`, and `docs/MILESTONE_GATE_M4_FULL.md` all confirm M3 closed 2026-05-08 and M4 completed 2026-05-15. `git diff --stat HEAD~5 HEAD` shows only `docs/audits/` changes in the last 5 commits — no new code-introduced staleness since the 2026-07-16 audit. CLAUDE.md is loaded on every session start; both stale entries corrupt every planning decision made from it.

2. **docs/CURRENT_STATE.md** — **STALE (1 item, persistent)**: `last_updated: 2026-05-15` frontmatter does not reflect four 2026-06-09 code commits (`d004f19 feat(data): add M4 campaign catalogs and room specs`, `a94c096 feat(core): extend mission story and regression runtime`, `dea2d41 feat(client): wire authored world routing and interactions`, `17da791 test(runtime): add Act I route campaign and world coverage`).
