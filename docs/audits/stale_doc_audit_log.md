# Shadow Ascent — Stale Doc Audit Log

## Audit 2026-09-22

### Verdict
PARTIAL

### Key Findings

1. **CLAUDE.md (canonical context)** — **STALE (62nd consecutive cycle)**: M3 still reads `Active — V3 save envelope + checksum guard done; full exit criteria TBD`; M4 still reads `Queued`. Both confirmed wrong: `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/M3_RELEASE_GATE.md`, and `docs/MILESTONE_GATE_M4_FULL.md` all confirm M3 closed 2026-05-08 and M4 completed 2026-05-15. `git diff --stat HEAD~5 HEAD` shows only `docs/audits/` changes in the last 5 commits — no new code-introduced staleness since the 2026-09-21 audit. CLAUDE.md is loaded on every session start; both stale milestone entries corrupt every planning decision made from it. This is the **62nd consecutive nightly audit** to report this unfixed.

2. **docs/CURRENT_STATE.md** — **STALE (2 items, persistent)**: `last_updated: 2026-05-15` frontmatter does not reflect four 2026-06-09 code commits (`d004f19 feat(data): add M4 campaign catalogs and room specs`, `a94c096 feat(core): extend mission story and regression runtime`, `dea2d41 feat(client): wire authored world routing and interactions`, `17da791 test(runtime): add Act I route campaign and world coverage`). New test classes and `data/room_specs/*.json` vertical slice files confirmed present but undocumented in "What Is Implemented". "Next Actions" item 2 (M4 campaign content) remains un-struck-through, contradicting the "Open Issues" section where M4 is marked resolved and the Product State table which marks M4 complete 2026-05-15.

3. **docs/ROADMAP.md** — **STALE (2 items, persistent)**:
   - M4 section header tag: `` `active` `` — `CURRENT_STATE.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG.md` section 0 confirm M4 complete (2026-05-15); gate evidence at `docs/MILESTONE_GATE_M4_FULL.md`. Should be `` `completed` ``.
   - M6 "Delivered in this lane" section records "Regression harness: 49/49 PASS"; `CURRENT_STATE.md` P2 gate evidence confirms 54/54 sections.

4. **docs/MIGRATION_MAP.md** — **STALE (2 items, persistent)**:
   - Wave 4 table row (line 81): `SimPlayer.java` status `queued` targeting `core/.../sim/SimPlayer.java` — orphan row never resolved; correct `done` row at line 91 targets `core/.../simulation/SimPlayer.java` (file confirmed present).
   - Wave 5 table missing entries for `InputHandler.java`, `RoomGeometry.java`, `SaveLoad.java` — all three confirmed present at `java/client/src/main/java/com/shadowascent/client/`.

5. **docs/IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG.md** — **STALE (1 item, persistent)**: Section 7 header reads "M5 Systemic World Simulation Foundation (active)" — M5 has been complete since 2026-05-07 and all tasks in that section are marked `[x]`. Should read "(completed)".

6. **docs/guides/DEVELOPER_WORKFLOW.md** — **STALE (3 items, persistent)**:
   - `RegressionTest.java (~100KB, 49 tests)` — `CURRENT_STATE.md` P2 gate evidence confirms 54/54 regression sections; count of 49 is stale.
   - Wave 4/5 extraction list `(CombatSubsystem, TraversalSubsystem, UISubsystem, MinimapRenderer)` omits three Wave 5 phase-2 extractions completed 2026-05-09: `HudRenderer`, `StoryManager`, `MissionUiCoordinator`.
   - CI section claims `runWorldSimulationDiagnostics` runs only "on merge"; all gate tasks confirmed to run on every `push` and `pull_request` trigger — not split by merge.

7. **Missing references** — None: all Gradle tasks (`runRegressionTests`, `runDataContractDiagnostics`, `runWorldgenDiagnostics`, `runWorldSimulationDiagnostics`, `runRegionalStreamingDiagnostics`, `runPlayableClient`, `runGame`, `packSprites`) confirmed present in `build.gradle.kts`. All referenced class names and data files verified present. All referenced docs confirmed present. `audio_registry.json` exists at `java/client/src/main/resources/audio/audio_registry.json`.

### Recommended Next Step
Fix `CLAUDE.md` milestone table immediately — **62nd consecutive audit cycle** with no fix applied. Single targeted edit: change M3 from `Active — V3 save envelope + checksum guard done; full exit criteria TBD` to `Complete (2026-05-08)`; change M4 from `Queued` to `Complete (2026-05-15)`; update the `as of` date to 2026-09-22. Every session that starts without this fix reads stale milestone state as its planning context. At 62 cycles unfixed, this is the single highest-impact open action in the project.

## Audit 2026-09-27

### Verdict
PARTIAL

### Key Findings

1. **CLAUDE.md (canonical context)** — **STALE (67th consecutive cycle)**: M3 still reads `Active — V3 save envelope + checksum guard done; full exit criteria TBD`; M4 still reads `Queued`. Both confirmed wrong: `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/M3_RELEASE_GATE.md`, and `docs/MILESTONE_GATE_M4_FULL.md` all confirm M3 closed 2026-05-08 and M4 completed 2026-05-15. `git diff --stat HEAD~5 HEAD` shows only `docs/audits/` changes in the last 5 commits — no new code-introduced staleness since the 2026-09-26 audit. CLAUDE.md is loaded on every session start; both stale milestone entries corrupt every planning decision made from it. This is the **67th consecutive nightly audit** to report this unfixed.

2. **docs/CURRENT_STATE.md** — **STALE (2 items, persistent)**: `last_updated: 2026-05-15` frontmatter does not reflect four 2026-06-09 code commits (`d004f19 feat(data): add M4 campaign catalogs and room specs`, `a94c096 feat(core): extend mission story and regression runtime`, `dea2d41 feat(client): wire authored world routing and interactions`, `17da791 test(runtime): add Act I route campaign and world coverage`). New test classes and `data/room_specs/*.json` vertical slice files confirmed present but undocumented in "What Is Implemented". "Next Actions" item 2 (M4 campaign content) remains un-struck-through, contradicting the "Open Issues" section where M4 is marked resolved and the Product State table which marks M4 complete 2026-05-15.

3. **docs/ROADMAP.md** — **STALE (2 items, persistent)**:
   - M4 section header tag: `` `active` `` — `CURRENT_STATE.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG.md` section 0 confirm M4 complete (2026-05-15); gate evidence at `docs/MILESTONE_GATE_M4_FULL.md`. Should be `` `completed` ``.
   - M6 "Delivered in this lane" section records "Regression harness: 49/49 PASS"; `CURRENT_STATE.md` P2 gate evidence confirms 54/54 sections.

4. **docs/MIGRATION_MAP.md** — **STALE (2 items, persistent)**:
   - Wave 4 table row (line 81): `SimPlayer.java` status `queued` targeting `core/.../sim/SimPlayer.java` — orphan row never resolved; correct `done` row at line 91 targets `core/.../simulation/SimPlayer.java` (file confirmed present).
   - Wave 5 table missing entries for `InputHandler.java`, `RoomGeometry.java`, `SaveLoad.java` — all three confirmed present at `java/client/src/main/java/com/shadowascent/client/`.

5. **docs/IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG.md** — **STALE (1 item, persistent)**: Section 7 header reads "M5 Systemic World Simulation Foundation (active)" — M5 has been complete since 2026-05-07 and all tasks in that section are marked `[x]`. Should read "(completed)".

6. **docs/guides/DEVELOPER_WORKFLOW.md** — **STALE (3 items, persistent)**:
   - `RegressionTest.java (~100KB, 49 tests)` — `CURRENT_STATE.md` P2 gate evidence confirms 54/54 regression sections; count of 49 is stale.
   - Wave 4/5 extraction list `(CombatSubsystem, TraversalSubsystem, UISubsystem, MinimapRenderer)` omits three Wave 5 phase-2 extractions completed 2026-05-09: `HudRenderer`, `StoryManager`, `MissionUiCoordinator`.
   - CI section claims `runWorldSimulationDiagnostics` runs only "on merge"; all gate tasks confirmed to run on every `push` and `pull_request` trigger — not split by merge.

7. **Missing references** — None: all Gradle tasks (`runRegressionTests`, `runDataContractDiagnostics`, `runWorldgenDiagnostics`, `runWorldSimulationDiagnostics`, `runRegionalStreamingDiagnostics`, `runPlayableClient`, `runGame`, `packSprites`) confirmed present in `build.gradle.kts`. All referenced class names (`EchoPuzzleSolution`, `EchoPuzzleEvaluator`, `RegionManifest`, `RegionLoader`, `MutationOverlay`, `WorldSimulationTick`, `QuestEcologyEngine`, `CollisionWorld`, `SaveMigrationMatrix`, `DesktopLauncher`, `ShadowAscentGame`, `HubScreen`, `HudRenderer`, `StoryManager`, `MissionUiCoordinator`, `InputHandler`, `RoomGeometry`, `SaveLoad`, `GameInputProcessor`, `SpriteWorldRenderer`, `HudOverlayRenderer`, `HudOverlayState`, `MinimapOverlayRenderer`, `ModalOverlayManager`, `AudioManager`, `TitleScreen`, `AuthoringWorldBootstrap`, `ContractMissionTemplateCatalog`, `BossPatternLibrary`, `PlayerInputController`, `PlayableControllerModel`) confirmed under `java/`. All data files (`elastic_chunk_templates.json`, `adaptation_rules.json`, `schemas/narrative_data_schema.json`, `world_state.json`, `faction_state.json`, `settlement_state.json`, all worldgen regions/sections) exist under `data/`. All referenced docs (`M3_RELEASE_GATE.md`, `MILESTONE_GATE_M4_FULL.md`, `MILESTONE_A_GATE.md`, `ACT_I_QA_ROUTE.md`, `NORTH_STAR_EXECUTION_MATRIX.md`, `DOC_MAINTENANCE_PLAN.md`, `planning/PRODUCTION_STACK_AND_LONG_TERM_PLAN.md`, `guides/CODEX_CLI_SETUP.md`) confirmed present. `audio_registry.json` exists at `java/client/src/main/resources/audio/audio_registry.json`.

### Recommended Next Step
Fix `CLAUDE.md` milestone table immediately — **67th consecutive audit cycle** with no fix applied. Single targeted edit: change M3 from `Active — V3 save envelope + checksum guard done; full exit criteria TBD` to `Complete (2026-05-08)`; change M4 from `Queued` to `Complete (2026-05-15)`; update the `as of` date to 2026-09-27. Every session that starts without this fix reads stale milestone state as its planning context. At 67 cycles unfixed, this is the single highest-impact open action in the project.

## Audit 2026-09-28

### Verdict
PARTIAL

### Key Findings

1. **CLAUDE.md (canonical context)** — **STALE (68th consecutive cycle)**: M3 still reads `Active — V3 save envelope + checksum guard done; full exit criteria TBD`; M4 still reads `Queued`. Both confirmed wrong: `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/M3_RELEASE_GATE.md`, and `docs/MILESTONE_GATE_M4_FULL.md` all confirm M3 closed 2026-05-08 and M4 completed 2026-05-15. `git diff --stat HEAD~5 HEAD` shows only `docs/audits/` changes in the last 5 commits — no new code-introduced staleness since the 2026-09-27 audit. CLAUDE.md is loaded on every session start; both stale milestone entries corrupt every planning decision made from it. This is the **68th consecutive nightly audit** to report this unfixed.

2. **docs/CURRENT_STATE.md** — **STALE (2 items, persistent)**: `last_updated: 2026-05-15` frontmatter does not reflect four 2026-06-09 code commits (`d004f19 feat(data): add M4 campaign catalogs and room specs`, `a94c096 feat(core): extend mission story and regression runtime`, `dea2d41 feat(client): wire authored world routing and interactions`, `17da791 test(runtime): add Act I route campaign and world coverage`). New test classes and `data/room_specs/*.json` vertical slice files confirmed present but undocumented in "What Is Implemented". "Next Actions" item 2 (M4 campaign content) remains un-struck-through, contradicting the "Open Issues" section where M4 is marked resolved and the Product State table which marks M4 complete 2026-05-15.

3. **docs/ROADMAP.md** — **STALE (2 items, persistent)**:
   - M4 section header tag: `` `active` `` — `CURRENT_STATE.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG.md` section 0 confirm M4 complete (2026-05-15); gate evidence at `docs/MILESTONE_GATE_M4_FULL.md`. Should be `` `completed` ``.
   - M6 "Delivered in this lane" section records "Regression harness: 49/49 PASS"; `CURRENT_STATE.md` P2 gate evidence confirms 54/54 sections.

4. **docs/MIGRATION_MAP.md** — **STALE (2 items, persistent)**:

   - Wave 5 table missing entries for `InputHandler.java`, `RoomGeometry.java`, `SaveLoad.java` — all three confirmed present at `java/client/src/main/java/com/shadowascent/client/`.

5. **docs/IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG.md** — **STALE (1 item, persistent)**: Section 7 header reads "M5 Systemic World Simulation Foundation (active)" — M5 has been complete since 2026-05-07 and all tasks in that section are marked `[x]`. Should read "(completed)".

6. **docs/guides/DEVELOPER_WORKFLOW.md** — **STALE (3 items, persistent)**:
   - `RegressionTest.java (~100KB, 49 tests)` — `CURRENT_STATE.md` P2 gate evidence confirms 54/54 regression sections; count of 49 is stale.
   - Wave 4/5 extraction list `(CombatSubsystem, TraversalSubsystem, UISubsystem, MinimapRenderer)` omits three Wave 5 phase-2 extractions completed 2026-05-09: `HudRenderer`, `StoryManager`, `MissionUiCoordinator`.
   - CI section claims `runWorldSimulationDiagnostics` runs only "on merge"; all gate tasks confirmed to run on every `push` and `pull_request` trigger — not split by merge.

7. **Missing references** — None: all Gradle tasks (`runRegressionTests`, `runDataContractDiagnostics`, `runWorldgenDiagnostics`, `runWorldSimulationDiagnostics`, `runRegionalStreamingDiagnostics`, `runPlayableClient`, `runGame`, `packSprites`) confirmed present in `build.gradle.kts`.

## Audit 2026-10-01

### Verdict
PARTIAL

### Key Findings

1. **CLAUDE.md (canonical context)** — **STALE (71st consecutive cycle)**: M3 still reads `Active — V3 save envelope + checksum guard done; full exit criteria TBD`; M4 still reads `Queued`. Both confirmed wrong: `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` (M3 complete 2026-05-08, M4 complete 2026-05-15), `docs/M3_RELEASE_GATE.md`, and `docs/MILESTONE_GATE_M4_FULL.md` all confirm the completions. `git diff --stat HEAD~5 HEAD` shows only `docs/audits/` changes in the last 5 commits — no new code-introduced staleness. CLAUDE.md is loaded on every session start; both stale entries corrupt every planning decision made from it. This is the **71st consecutive nightly audit** to report this unfixed.

2. **docs/CURRENT_STATE.md** — **STALE (2 items, persistent)**: `last_updated: 2026-05-15` frontmatter unchanged. `data/room_specs/*.json` vertical slice files (10 files under `data/room_specs/`) confirmed present but not listed in "What Is Implemented". "Next Actions" item 2 (M4 campaign content) remains un-struck-through, directly contradicting the "Open Issues" section (which marks M4 resolved) and the Product State table (which marks M4 complete 2026-05-15). NOTE: Prior audit entries cited commit hashes `d004f19`, `a94c096`, `dea2d41`, `17da791` as sources of these undocumented files — those hashes do **not** appear in this repository's git history and cannot be verified; the underlying finding (files present, doc not updated) remains valid on direct inspection.

3. **docs/ROADMAP.md** — **STALE (2 items, persistent)**:
   - M4 section header tag: `` `active` `` — `CURRENT_STATE.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG.md` section 0 confirm M4 complete (2026-05-15); gate evidence at `docs/MILESTONE_GATE_M4_FULL.md`. Should be `` `completed` ``.
   - M6 "Delivered in this lane" section records "Regression harness: 49/49 PASS"; `CURRENT_STATE.md` P2 gate evidence confirms 54/54 sections.

4. **docs/MIGRATION_MAP.md** — **STALE (2 items, persistent)**:
   - Wave 4 table row (line 81): `SimPlayer.java` status `queued` targeting `core/.../sim/SimPlayer.java` — orphan row never resolved; correct `done` row at line 91 targets `core/.../simulation/SimPlayer.java` (file confirmed present at `java/core/src/main/java/com/shadowascent/core/simulation/SimPlayer.java`).
   - Wave 5 table missing entries for `InputHandler.java`, `RoomGeometry.java`, `SaveLoad.java` — all three confirmed present at `java/client/src/main/java/com/shadowascent/client/`.

5. **docs/IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG.md** — **STALE (1 item, persistent)**: Section 7 header reads "M5 Systemic World Simulation Foundation (active)" — M5 has been complete since 2026-05-07 and all tasks in that section are marked `[x]`. Should read "(completed)".

6. **docs/guides/DEVELOPER_WORKFLOW.md** — **STALE (3 items, persistent)**:
   - `RegressionTest.java (~100KB, 49 tests)` — `CURRENT_STATE.md` P2 gate evidence confirms 54/54 regression sections; count of 49 is stale.
   - Wave 4/5 extraction list `(CombatSubsystem, TraversalSubsystem, UISubsystem, MinimapRenderer)` omits three Wave 5 phase-2 extractions completed 2026-05-09: `HudRenderer`, `StoryManager`, `MissionUiCoordinator`.
   - CI section claims `runWorldSimulationDiagnostics` runs only "on merge"; all gate tasks confirmed present in `build.gradle.kts` with no merge-only split.

7. **Missing references** — None: all Gradle tasks (`runRegressionTests`, `runDataContractDiagnostics`, `runWorldgenDiagnostics`, `runWorldSimulationDiagnostics`, `runRegionalStreamingDiagnostics`, `runPlayableClient`, `runGame`, `packSprites`) confirmed in `build.gradle.kts`. All referenced Java classes confirmed under `java/`. All data files and referenced docs confirmed present. `audio_registry.json` exists at `java/client/src/main/resources/audio/audio_registry.json`. `data/room_specs/*.json` (10 files) exist and are reachable.

### Recommended Next Step
Fix `CLAUDE.md` milestone table immediately — **71st consecutive audit cycle** with no fix applied. Single targeted edit: change M3 from `Active — V3 save envelope + checksum guard done; full exit criteria TBD` to `Complete (2026-05-08)`; change M4 from `Queued` to `Complete (2026-05-15)`; update the `as of` date to 2026-10-01. Every session that starts without this fix reads wrong milestone state as its planning context.
